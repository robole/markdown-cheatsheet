- Complete reference: A more detailed look at all things markdown can be found in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/robole/markdown-cheatsheet/wiki), which is the same text as `markdown.md`. 


- `Test.md`: This that has all of the snippets from the cheatsheet, and more, if you want to test how an application handles the different features of markdown and extended markdown. There are some inconsistencies in different applications, so this can be helpful to figure that out quickly.

- `Extended Markdown Applicaiton Support.xlsx`: A spreadsheet to show which extended markdown features some particular applications support. Atom, Notepad++, Github and Visual Code Studio are included. This table is inside the cheatsheet.
