# Markdown Cheatsheet

This is a comprehensive and succint cheatsheet for markdown. 

`Markdown Cheatsheet.pdf` is created from the well-formatted `Markdown Cheatsheet.docx`, you can edit that yourself if you want to create a more personal style!

A more detailed look at all things markdown can be found in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/robole/markdown-cheatsheet/wiki), which is the same text as `markdown.md`. 

In the cheatsheet, there is a table of which extended syntax features are supported by some of the applications that I use.

There is a `test.md` that has all of the snippets from the cheatsheet, and more, if you want to test how an application handles the different features of markdown and extended markdown. There are some inconsistencies in different applications, so it can be helpful to give a quick overview.
