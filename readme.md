# Markdown Cheatsheet

*Pull requests are welcome*

I wanted to create a comprehensive and succint cheatsheet for markdown, over time I noticed some inconsistencies when I was using markdown in different applications, and on different platforms. It irked me, and I wanted to know what the real f-ing standard is!

The PDF cheatsheet is created from a well-formatted Word Document, you can edit that yourself if you want to create a more personal style!

More depth is gone into in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/robole/markdown-cheatsheet/wiki), which is the same text as `markdown.md`.

There is an `test.md` that has all of the snippets from the cheatsheet, and more, if you want to test how an application handles markdown.
